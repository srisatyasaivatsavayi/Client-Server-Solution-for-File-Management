# Client-Server-Solution-for-File-Management
A client-server application can be simplified to describe a model wherein a program (the server) receives and handles requests of services done by another program (the client).  The file-managing server is required to handle multiple clients connecting to it where each client shall work in a directory of their own and with files inaccessible to other users.  The client is taking a more passive role. When started up, it should present the user with the option to either login or register to the server.
